# Varun's First CS193 Homework

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. The theme is weird, but it looks like one of the super hacker ones with the neon green and black background. 
Github is pretty lit tho. Clean and stuff but there's a pretty thic learning curve. 

### Markdown

```markdown

- The teachers aren't old
- Sounds like a cool class
- Homework seems pretty easy
- Skills that we learn, like using GitHub, are actually pretty useful

```
